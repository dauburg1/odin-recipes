    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Buffalo Mac and Cheese is a Gangsta Chef classic loved by all! It can be made
             with any cheese desired but I prefer a sharp cheddar and pepper jack. You'll be
             using cheese everywhere with a combination of a cheese sauce and layering cheese
             throughout the dish, for a the ultimate mac and cheese. In combination with cheesy
             richness you'll be adding crunchy spicy buffalo chicken for that added awesomeness!
             Perfect for party's, dinner or the hell of it!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. of preferred dried pasta (I use elbow and shells)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded sharp cheddar</li>
            <li>2 cups pepper jack</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>6-8 breaded chicken tenders</li>
            <li>Favorite buffalo sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 and grease a 9x13" baking dish</li>
            <li>Bring large pot of salted water to boil. When boiling add dried pasta and cook to
                al dente. 8-10 min. Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil when done.</li>
            <li>While water is coming to boil shred both cheeses.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Once melted slowly incorporate
                flour while whisking to combine. Cook for about 1 minute continuing to whisk.</li>
            <li>Start slowly adding in about 2 cups of milk and half and half while whisking
                constantly until mixture is smooth. Slowly add remaining milk and half and half.</li>
            <li>Continue to heat over medium heat, whisking often until thickened (should be very thick like condensed soup)</li>
            <li>While sauce thickens add chicken strips to air fryer at 400 degrees for 12 min tossing
                halfway through</li>
            <li>Remove sauce from heat once thickened and add spices and 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses.
                Stir until melted them stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheeses and stir until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl mix drained pasta with cheese sauce. Mix until all pasta is nice and cheesy.
                Then add half of the cheesy pasta to baking dish spreading throughout pan. Add a layer of shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Once chicken tenders are done remove from air fryer cut into chunks and toss with buffalo sauce
                and add to baking dish.</li>
            <li>Add remaining cheesy pasta covering chicken and shredded cheese and top with remaining shredded cheese.
                Bake on 350 for 15-18 min until warm and top cheese is melted. (Can broil for a few min if you want top cheese crunchy.)</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy! Top with additional buffalo sauce for more kick!</li>
        </ol>
